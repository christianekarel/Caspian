**The control plane for AI coding agents.**

Run multiple agents in parallel. Each in its own workspace. All from one screen.

## The Problem

Running multiple Claude Code agents? It gets messy fast.

**Here's what happens:**
- 5 terminals, 5 agents, and you've already forgotten what the third one was doing
- No bird's-eye view — just endless cmd+tab until your brain gives up
- All agents stomping around the same directory, overwriting each other's work
- Close a terminal, poof — context gone forever

**The real problem?** You can't scale. Your brain becomes the bottleneck. More agents = more chaos.

**The tradeoff nobody asked for:** Run a few agents with focused tasks, or run many with vague ones. Pick one.

There's no control plane. No dashboard. No structure. Until now.

## Caspian

One screen. All your agents. Each in its own isolated workspace.

Run 10 agents on 10 focused tasks. See everything. Control everything.

**Granularity *and* scale.**

## Features

| What | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|
| **Isolated Workspaces** | Each agent gets its own worktree. No more stepping on each other's toes. |
| **Parallel Execution** | Run as many agents as you want, simultaneously. |
| **Single Dashboard** | All agents, one screen. Your brain can relax. |
| **Live Monitoring** | Watch every agent in real-time. See what they see. |
| **Persistent Context** | Close the app, grab coffee, come back. Everything's still there. |
| **PR Integration** | Done? Ship it as a pull request. |

## Quick Start

> **Note:** Caspian currently supports macOS only.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Rust 1.77+
- Claude Code CLI

### Get running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheCaspianAI/Caspian.git
cd Caspian
npm install
npm run tauri:dev
```

### Build for production

```bash
npm run tauri:build
```

Output: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`

## How It Works

```
1. Add repo     →  Point Caspian at your project
2. Create node  →  Spin up an isolated workspace
3. Run agent    →  Launch Claude Code in that workspace
4. Watch        →  See everything in real-time
5. Review       →  Check the changes
6. Ship         →  Create a PR
```

## Roadmap

**Coming soon: Custom Workflows**

Finding the best way to work with AI agents is hard. Beads? Gastown? GSD? Something else entirely?

We're building workflow templates that capture best practices — so you can plug in what works for your team instead of figuring it out from scratch.
